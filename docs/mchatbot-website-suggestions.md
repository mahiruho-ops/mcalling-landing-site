### **Areas for improvement**

Here are suggestions to make the site stronger and more conversion-friendly:

1. Clarify target audience & value proposition

   * It’s clear the product is for multi-agent AI chatbots across every channel, but **who exactly** is the buyer? (Enterprise CXO? Customer service head? Dev/IT lead?). Making the target persona explicit helps.

   * The value proposition could be simplified: e.g., “Cut your chatbot rollout time by X%”, “Handle Y more messages per hour”, or “Reduce cost of service by Z%.” Right now there’s a lot of features, less of “what you get”.

2. Highlight proof & credibility

   * case studies, metrics, or testimonials on the front page. These boost trust.

   * If this is a beta, you might still show pilot results or “In pilot with …” to add validation.

3. Prioritise benefits over features

   * There’s an excellent list of technical features (multi-agent execution, memory management, workflow canvas, etc.). But many users decide based on **what outcomes** they will get (faster time-to-market, lower cost, higher satisfaction). So add clear benefit headlines.

   * Consider using “Before & After” or “Challenge → Solution” storytelling: e.g., “A large enterprise had 10 chatbots on different channels and spent 3 months each. With mChatBot you roll in 4 weeks.”

4. Improve UX & scanning

   * The site is long and content-dense. For users who skim, adding **anchor links** or “What you’ll learn” sections can help.

   * Use more visuals — diagrams, flow charts, screenshots of your builder canvas, real UI. This helps people imagine the tool rather than just reading text.

   * The “Join Waitlist” is good, but if someone is a ready customer (not beta), you might also offer “Request Demo” or “Schedule Call”.

5. Risk / readiness messaging

   * If the product is still in beta (“Beta Release November 2025”), clarify what that means: “Support, SLA, integrations may be limited”. This transparency can prevent disappointment. [MChatbot](https://mchatbot.ai/)

   * If full launch is near, present that timeline or roadmap so prospects feel they’re not waitlisting forever.

6. SEO & content expansions

   * Consider adding a blog or resource section: “How multi-agent chatbots work”, “Use cases in retail/hospitality”, “Implementation checklist”. This helps with search visibility and builds authority.

   * Metadata (title tags, meta descriptions) should reflect keywords your audience searches (“enterprise chatbot platform”, “multi-channel AI bots”, etc).

7. Pricing / packaging visibility

   * Many buyers want at least ball-park pricing or packaging tiers. Even if custom, you could say “starts from USD X/month” or “Enterprise pricing per deployment”. If nothing else, a “Contact us for pricing” badge.
