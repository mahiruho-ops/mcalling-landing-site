## Example Use Cases (How it Works)

### 1. Account Opening & KYC Assist
- **Journey**: User chooses “Open account” (Web/WhatsApp) → Agent explains options → Digital KYC (ID upload, liveness check) → Instant verification → Account created and welcome pack sent.
- **Sample Chat**:
    - User: "Open zero-balance account."
    - Agent: "Upload ID please. ... Liveness verified. You're all set!"
- **Value**: Simple, paperless onboarding with fewer branch visits.

### 2. Loan or Card Pre-qualification
- **Journey**: User asks, "Am I eligible?" (any channel) → Agent collects basics → Pulls credit score (non-impact) → Shows offers → Lets user instantly apply or book appointment.
- **Sample Chat**:
    - User: "Need ₹3L personal loan."
    - Agent: "You may be eligible for ₹2.5–3L. Start pre-application?"
- **Value**: Transparency and quick steps to application.

### 3. Instant Balance, Statements & Limits
- **Journey**: User requests "Statement for Aug" or "Increase limit" → Agent verifies with OTP → Shares statement (via chat/email PDF) or starts limit increase process.
- **Sample Chat**:
    - User: "Share July statement."
    - Agent: "Sent to your email. Need help with anything else?"
- **Value**: 24x7 service, no calls needed.

### 4. Insurance Policy Service & Premiums
- **Journey**: User checks "Due date?" or requests "Premium receipt" → Agent gets policy details → Enables address changes, payments, document uploads—guides user to receipt.
- **Sample Chat**:
    - User: "Pay premium now."
    - Agent: "Here’s the link. You’ll receive a receipt after payment."
- **Value**: Quicker renewals, less paperwork.

### 5. Claims First Notification of Loss (FNOL) & Status
- **Journey**: User clicks “Report claim” or triggered by app event → Agent collects incident info and documents/photos → Checks coverage → Creates claim → Gives checklist and status updates.
- **Sample Chat**:
    - User: "Rear bump, minor dent."
    - Agent: "Claim started. Please upload photos. Garage list sent."
- **Value**: Fast, transparent claims process.

### 6. Fraud Alerts & Transaction Disputes
- **Journey**: User reports "Unknown debit" or system detects risk → Agent verifies user → Instantly blocks card if suspicious → Opens dispute ticket and shares status.
- **Sample Chat**:
    - User: "Not my charge."
    - Agent: "Card blocked. Your dispute is being processed."
- **Value**: Reduce fraud loss, build trust.

### 7. Collections & Payment Reminders
- **Journey**: Agent notifies users with upcoming dues via WhatsApp/SMS/IVR → Offers pay-now, split, or new plan options → Processes collection and updates CRM.
- **Sample Chat**:
    - Agent: "EMI due in 3 days. Pay now or want to set up a plan?"
- **Value**: Higher collections, better customer experience.

### 8. Safe Wealth & Advisory Q&A
- **Journey**: User asks about investments (e.g., "FD vs debt fund?") → Agent shares only approved, general info → Offers callback from human advisor—never delivers personal recommendations.
- **Sample Chat**:
    - User: "Debt fund vs fixed deposit?"
    - Agent: "Here’s a comparison table. Want an advisor to contact you?"
- **Value**: Engage without compliance worries.
