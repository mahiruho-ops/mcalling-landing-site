## Real Use Cases (with Flow Samples)

Each use case below outlines: Trigger → Agent → Node Libraries → Channels → Workflow → Sample conversations

### 1. Guided Selling & Bundles (Boosting Conversion)
- **When it happens:** Shopper asks for advice on your website or Instagram DM.
- **What happens:** The chatbot collects preferences, suggests bundles, applies promos, and shares a checkout link — optionally follows up with a reminder.
- **Sample conversation:**
    - Shopper: “Gift set for ₹2,000 budget.”
    - Bot: “This bundle fits. Add and apply FEST10?”
- _Why users like it:_ Chat turns into cart, instantly. No hunting for products.

### 2. Back-in-Stock & Preorder Alerts
- **When it happens:** Shopper requests restock notification or preorders an item.
- **What happens:** The bot tracks inventory, notifies users on WhatsApp or Email when items are available, offers a limited deal, and links to checkout.
- **Sample conversation:**
    - Bot: “Your size is back. 10% off for 24h. Buy now?”
- _How it helps:_ No more lost sales from stock-outs.

### 3. Cart Recovery & Offer Nurturing
- **When it happens:** Someone abandons their shopping cart.
- **What happens:** Automated reminders go out via WhatsApp, Email, or SMS, with tailored offers and an easy way to rebuild the cart and buy in one click.
- **Sample conversation:**
    - Bot: “Still eyeing the tote? Extra 5% off today. Rebuild cart?”

- _Result:_ More conversions, less manual chasing.

### 4. Order Tracking & Exception Handling
- **When it happens:** Shoppers want to check order status or have delivery questions.
- **What happens:** Bot verifies order, shows live status, notifies delays or issues, offers support, and logs the interaction.
- **Sample conversation:**
    - Shopper: “Where’s my order?”
    - Bot: “Out for delivery. ETA 6–8 PM.”
- _Why it matters:_ Reduces “Where is my order?” (WISMO) tickets.

### 5. Returns, Exchanges & RMAs
- **When it happens:** Customers want to return or exchange an item.
- **What happens:** The bot validates the order, offers exchanges or credits, handles RMA creation and pickup, and notifies status updates.
- **Sample conversation:**
    - Shopper: “Size too small.”
    - Bot: “Exchange to M? Free pickup arranged.”
- _Impact:_ Retain revenue by offering instant alternatives.

### 6. Store Pickup (BOPIS) & Appointments

- **Sample conversation:**
    - Bot: “Available at Phoenix Mall. Hold and book 6 PM?”
- _Benefit:_ Drives foot traffic and faster fulfillment.

### 7. Subscription Management

- **What happens:** Bot answers using approved information, filters risky/inappropriate content, logs interest, and can guide more shopping.
