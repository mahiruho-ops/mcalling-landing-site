## Practical Use Case Examples

Below are common public service flows you can launch using MChatbot—showing the user journey with channel and automation support.

### 1. File a Grievance or Complaint (e.g. Municipal Issues)

- **How it works**: You report an issue (like a pothole or streetlight outage) via WhatsApp or website.
- **What happens**: The chatbot collects details, photos, and location, creates a case, and assigns it to the right team with an SLA. You receive tracking links and get notified on status or escalation.
- **Example**:
    - Citizen: “Broken streetlight on Main Road.”
    - Bot: “Case #M-128 opened. Resolution due in 48h. Track your case here.”

### 2. Pay Utility Bills and Enquire Dues

- **How it works**: You check or pay your water/electricity bill instantly over WhatsApp, web, or IVR.
- **What happens**: The bot confirms your account, shows dues, handles payment securely, and sends receipts and timely reminders.
- **Example**:
    - Citizen: “Pay my water bill.”
    - Bot: “Payment link sent. Receipt will follow on WhatsApp.”

### 3. Apply for Legal Certificates (Birth/Death/Residence)

- **How it works**: Start a certificate application process on your preferred channel.
- **What happens**: The chatbot verifies your identity, collects required documents digitally, handles fee payments, submits your application, and notifies you when ready.
- **Example**:
    - Citizen: “Apply for birth certificate.”
    - Bot: “Your documents are verified and fee paid. Expect digital delivery in 3–5 working days.”

### 4. Apply for Permits and Licenses (e.g. Driving/Trade)

- **What happens**: The chatbot checks eligibility, collects documents, lets you pick appointment slots (like for driving tests), processes payments, and keeps you updated.
- **Example**:
    - Applicant: “Renew driving license.”
    - Bot: “Earliest slot is Fri 10 AM. Shall I book it for you?”

### 5. Property Tax Status and Payments

- **How it works**: Instant lookup and payment for property tax via WhatsApp, web, or IVR.
- **What happens**: Fetch your property’s tax dues, share payment breakups, accept payments, provide receipts, and set reminders for the next cycle.

    - Citizen: “Pay property tax now.”
    - Bot: “Tax amount is ₹6,500. Payment link sent. Receipt will be updated here.”

### 6. Public Health: Info and Appointment Scheduling

- **How it works**: Receive information about health advisories, vaccination drives, and book slots.
- **What happens**: Share verified info about health camps, allow slot booking, send notifications and reminders, and follow up with feedback surveys.
- **Example**:
    - Citizen: “Where can I get a flu shot?”
    - Bot: “Vaccination camp at Ward-14 community centre, Sat at 10:30 AM. Schedule a slot?”

### 7. Public Transport: Live Info & Ticketing

- **How it works**: Ask for bus/metro timings or buy digital tickets.
- **What happens**: Bot fetches live ETAs, offers ticket/passes for purchase, sends digital QR codes, and logs your request.
- **Example**:
    - Citizen: “Next metro from MG Road?”
    - Bot: “ETA: 4 mins. Would you like to buy a single-ride QR ticket?”

### 8. Emergency Alerts & Disaster Broadcasts

- **How it works**: Receive important government alerts via multiple channels (WhatsApp, SMS, IVR, web).
