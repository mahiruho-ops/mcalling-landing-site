## Example Use Cases & Sample Flows

Below are real-world scenarios showing how hospitality teams and guests use MChatbot:

### 1. Direct Room Booking

- **How it works**: The guest starts on the website (“Book Now”) or scans a WhatsApp QR at the hotel.
- **Flow**: The chatbot collects stay dates, offers rooms/rates, suggests upgrades, completes the booking, and takes payment/guarantee securely.
- **Sample Conversation**
    - Guest: “Room for 2, 13–15 May.”
    - Agent: “Deluxe ₹6,800/night; Suite ₹9,900/night. Upgrade to Suite with lounge access?”
    - Guest: “Suite. Book.”
    - Agent: “Booked. Confirmation sent. See you soon!”
- _Benefit:_ Guests can book and upgrade in one seamless chat from anywhere, any device.

### 2. Pre-Arrival Check-in & Upsell

- **How it works**: Automatic outreach 48 hours pre-arrival (via WhatsApp or email).
- **Flow**: The chatbot verifies guest details, offers online check-in, recommends add-ons like airport pickup or late checkout, and notifies front desk of updates.
- **Sample Conversation**
    - Agent: “Online check-in available. Add airport pickup at ₹1200?”
    - Guest: “Yes. Also late checkout.”
    - Agent: “Done. See you tomorrow!”
- _Benefit:_ Earlier check-in, smoother arrival, and more add-on revenue.

### 3. Digital Concierge & Recommendations

- **How it works**: The guest asks for local recommendations or on-property info at any time.
- **Flow**: Bot suggests options (onsite dining, local experiences), can book restaurant tables, remembers preferences, and hands off to staff if needed.
- **Sample Conversation**
    - Guest: “Dinner for 2 at 8?”
    - Agent: “Italian or Indian? Italian table at Trattoria confirmed for 8 PM.”
- _Benefit:_ Instant answers and actions right in the guest’s preferred channel.

### 4. Housekeeping or Maintenance Requests

- **How it works**: Guests request items (“extra towels”) or report issues (“AC not cooling”).
- **Flow**: Bot classifies the request, creates an ops ticket, notifies teams, updates guest with ETA, and follows up for feedback.
- **Sample Conversation**
    - Guest: “Extra towels please.”
    - Agent: “On the way in 10 minutes.”
- _Benefit:_ Faster issue resolution and improved guest experience.

### 5. Event & Group Inquiries

- **How it works**: An event planner uses the website to request a proposal.
- **Flow**: Chatbot qualifies request (date, size), creates a lead in CRM, offers site visit, and hands off to sales with all details logged.
- **Sample Conversation**
    - Planner: “Conference for 80, next month.”
    - Agent: “Ballroom fits 120. Site visit tomorrow 4 PM?”
- _Benefit:_ Capture more group/event leads instantly and streamline follow-up.

### 6. Post-Stay Review & Loyalty

- **How it works**: After checkout, the bot requests guest feedback, sends a review link, and issues a loyalty offer if appropriate.
- **Flow**: Collect CSAT/NPS rating, prompt for public review if satisfied, route alerts to manager if not, and send win-back or thank-you offers.
- **Sample Conversation**
    - Agent: “How was your stay?”
    - Guest: “Great!”
    - Agent: “Thank you! Would you share a quick review?”
- _Benefit:_ Higher review scores and actionable guest feedback without extra staff time.
