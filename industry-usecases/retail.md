## Common Retail Use Cases & Sample Flows

The following examples describe how you can use MChatbot as a shopper, and how retail teams can deploy typical automated flows.

### 1. Finding Products & Guided Shopping

**How it works:**  
You ask for advice on products via website chat or WhatsApp prompt. The chatbot learns your preferences (style, use-case, price), suggests matching products, applies available promo codes, helps add items to cart, and sends you a checkout link.

**Sample chat:**
- Shopper: “Running shoes for flat feet under ₹5,000.”
- Bot: “These two fit your need. Add size 9?”
- Shopper: “Yes.”
- Bot: “Added. 10% off today — here’s your checkout link.”

_Benefit: Find and buy the right product without confusion or searching through endless menus._  

---

### 2. Order Tracking & Notifications

**How it works:**  
Enter your order ID on WhatsApp or web to get real-time status and estimated delivery times. MChatbot will notify you of delivery exceptions or changes and offer support if something’s wrong.

**Sample chat:**
- Shopper: “Track #A1276.”
- Bot: “Out for delivery. ETA today 6–8 PM.”

_Benefit: No need to call customer service for updates—get answers instantly._

---

### 3. Returns, Exchanges, & Pickups

**How it works:**  
Request a return or exchange by messaging the bot. MChatbot checks if the return is eligible, arranges a pickup, and can offer suggestions for exchanges or credits to help you complete a swap instead of a return.

**Sample chat:**
- Shopper: “Size too big.”
- Bot: “Want to exchange for M? Free pickup arranged. Credit available if you prefer.”

_Benefit: Make returns simple and convenient, with a focus on satisfaction and retention._

---

### 4. Cart Recovery & Offer Nurture

**How it works:**  
If you leave items in your cart, MChatbot sends a reminder and can apply targeted incentives or rebuild your cart if you return.

**Sample chat:**
- Bot: “Still eyeing the trail shoes? Extra 5% off ends today. Want me to rebuild your cart?”
- Shopper: “Yes.”

_Benefit: Get helpful reminders and exclusive offers based on your interest._  

---

### 5. Finding Stores & Booking Appointments

**How it works:**  
Ask where to find available stock in a location, reserve an item, or book a try-on/pickup slot.

**Sample chat:**
- Shopper: “Size 9 in Andheri?”
- Bot: “Available at Infinity Mall. Hold and book 6 PM?”

_Benefit: Quickly locate and reserve products, and schedule store visits._

---

### 6. Click-and-Collect (BOPIS)

**How it works:**  
When you select store pickup at checkout, MChatbot confirms your order, sends you a pickup code when ready, and collects feedback after pickup.

**Sample chat:**
- Bot: “Order ready. Pickup code 4721.”

---

### 7. Loyalty, Offers & Personalization

**How it works:**  
Log in or respond to campaigns to see your membership status, points, and receive curated picks or exclusive offers.

**Sample chat:**
- Bot: “Gold tier: 15% off on new arrivals. Want curated looks?”

---

### 8. Customer Support & Help

**How it works:**  
Ask the bot common support questions (address change, order cancel, warranty). Simple cases are resolved instantly; complex issues are escalated to a live agent if needed.

**Sample chat:**
- Shopper: “Wrong address.”
- Bot: “Updated before dispatch. Anything else I can help with?”

---

## Getting Started as a Shopper

- Look for chat widgets on retail websites, or scan WhatsApp QR codes online/in-store to start.
- Say what you need (“track order,” “need blue sneakers,” “return shoes”) — the bot guides you through each step.
- For help that's not automated, request a handoff to a person.
